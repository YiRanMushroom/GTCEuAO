Current Functionalities:
1. Add and widen configs about overclocking logic
2. Add automatic platform energy to GTEU conversion
3. Add configs to control processing array chance and tier
4. Change structures of multiblock machines, making them earlier accessible, and enhance their functions:
    1. Processing Array: Allow you to use normal glass, and more places can be used to put multiblock components.
5. Add configs to determine weather something has easier recipes.
    1. Processing Arrays
    2. Circuit Assemblers
6. Add configs to modify Parallel Logic

---------------------------------------------------
TODO:
1. Change some recipes, which could be enabled in configs.
